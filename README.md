# Product Transaction Dashboard

Overview

This project consists of a backend API that fetches product transaction data from a third-party API, initializes a database with this data, and provides various endpoints to retrieve and analyze transaction information. The frontend displays a transaction table, statistics, and charts based on the retrieved data, allowing users to filter and visualize product transactions for a selected month.
